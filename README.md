# mindmap

Brief summary: this is an unfinished 2014 project by [Egg Syntax](https://github.com/eggsyntax/) and [George Kierstein](https://github.com/MissInterpret) exploring the possibility of mindmaps as a fundamentally different way of representing code that's deeply integrated with the project planning process, that isn't limited to plain text files as the organizing method for code, and that can take advantage of the human brain's exceptional visual/spatial memory and pattern recognition.

This was our mutual Clojure learning project, and before it got very far we moved on to exploring a startup idea, but I still think this is an idea with considerable potential. Because we were such Clojure novices, we got bogged down on overengineering the data model, so the code is probably much less interesting or useful than the documentation (although here in 2022 I haven't gone back to review it).

In the interest of conceptual dogfooding, documentation is as a mindmap in the XMind format: [free download here](https://www.xmind.net/), in the `doc` directory.
