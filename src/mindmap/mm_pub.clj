Adding Validation to Refs
Database transactions maintain consistency through various integrity
checks. You can do something similar with Clojureâ€™s transactional
memory, by specifying a validation function when you create a ref:
(ref initial-state options*)
; options include:
; :validator validate-fn

TODO

Timestamps (which only hypermap nodes have)
separate out per-context functionality


Node ID remains constant when node changes (eg new title)
    - double-check existing code


Nodes and edges don't know anything about each other. An edge doesn't know what nodes it connects. Only the mindmap knows.
"

"
There might be an interesting argument that we shouldn't even have nodes or edges in the mindmap,
just a hashmap of entities by id, each of which has a type, eg :node or :edge. Then getting all
nodes just means filtering entities on :type :node. But I suppose that's just begging for
efficiency problems.
"

; There's redundancy in get-mm/get-node, and in get-head/get-cur,
; which could be factored out, but I'm deliberately
; leaving them separate because a) we need to be careful to keep them
; separated in our mental models, and b) we may want to change the
; implementation of one or both.
